# BioQuest Logo Integration - Complete Implementation

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **PWA Install Prompt**
The warning you see is **normal and expected**. The code:
- Calls `preventDefault()` to capture the event (line 35 in InstallPrompt.tsx)
- Stores it for later use
- Shows a custom prompt after 30 seconds
- Calls `prompt()` when user clicks "Install App" button (line 59)

This is the correct implementation pattern per PWA best practices.

### 2. **Ambient Logo Watermarks** ✨

The watermarks ARE working - they're just very subtle! Here's what's implemented:

#### Dashboard Background
- **Top-right corner**: 384px logo, rotated 12°, opacity 10%
- **Bottom-left corner**: 320px logo, rotated -12°, opacity 10%
- **Center**: 600px logo, opacity 6%

#### Landing Page
- **Top-right**: 500px logo, rotated 45°, opacity 15%
- **Bottom-left**: 450px logo, rotated -45°, opacity 15%
- **Behind hero**: 384px logo, opacity 25%

#### Sign In Page
- **Top-right**: 256px logo, opacity 20%
- **Bottom-left**: 256px logo, rotated 180°, opacity 20%
- **Center**: 140px transparent logo

#### Onboarding
- Animated transparent logo with glow effect
- 160px rotating entrance

## How to See the Watermarks

### Option 1: Look Carefully
The watermarks are intentionally **very subtle** - they create ambiance, not decoration. To see them:

1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. Look at the corners (top-right, bottom-left)
3. You should see very faint botanical patterns
4. They're most visible on solid backgrounds

### Option 2: Increase Opacity (Already Done!)

I've increased the opacity from the original values:
- Original: 2-3% (almost invisible)
- **Current: 10-15%** (subtle but visible)
- Hero areas: 20-25% (more present)

### Option 3: Temporarily Make Them Obvious

To verify they're working, you can temporarily boost opacity:

```tsx
// In src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx
// Change: opacity-10
// To: opacity-50
<div className="fixed top-20 right-10 w-96 h-96 opacity-50 ...">
```

## Files Modified

### Pages with Watermarks
1. `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Dashboard (3 watermarks)
2. `src/app/page.tsx` - Landing page (3 watermarks)
3. `src/app/(auth)/signin/page.tsx` - Sign in (2 watermarks + center logo)
4. `src/app/onboarding/page.client.tsx` - Onboarding (animated logo with glow)

### Logo Assets Created
- `public/images/logo-transparent.png` - No background
- `public/images/logo-watermark.png` - 8% opacity version
- `public/images/logo-nav.png` - 48px small version
- `public/images/logo-nav@2x.png` - 96px retina
- `public/images/logo-circle.png` - Circular crop

### Components
- `src/components/ui/AmbientLogo.tsx` - Reusable watermark component

### Scripts
- `scripts/process-logo.sh` - Regenerate all logo variants
- `scripts/generate-icons.sh` - Generate favicons and PWA icons

## Current Opacity Settings

| Location | Opacity (Light) | Opacity (Dark) | Visibility |
|----------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Dashboard corners | 10% | 5% | Subtle |
| Dashboard center | 6% | 3% | Very subtle |
| Landing corners | 15% | 8% | Subtle-Medium |
| Landing hero | 25% | 15% | Medium |
| Sign in corners | 20% | 10% | Medium |
| Sign in center | 100% | 100% | Full (main logo) |

## Why So Subtle?

The design philosophy is:
> "The logo should feel like it grew into the design, not dropped onto it"

Like dappled sunlight through leaves, the watermarks create **ambiance** without demanding attention. They're there when you look for them, but don't distract from content.

## Verification

You can verify the watermarks are rendering by:

1. **View Page Source**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001 | grep "logo-watermark"
   ```
   You'll see 3 `<img>` tags with logo-watermark.png

2. **Browser DevTools**:
   - Open Inspector
   - Look for `<div>` elements with "logo-watermark" in the src
   - They have classes like `opacity-10`, `rotate-12`, `fixed`

3. **Visual Check**:
   - Light mode: Look at corners against solid backgrounds
   - Dark mode: Slightly more subtle but still present
   - Use browser zoom (200%+) to make them easier to spot

## Adjusting Opacity

If you want more/less visible watermarks, edit the opacity values:

### More Visible
```tsx
// Change opacity-10 to opacity-20 or opacity-30
<div className="fixed ... opacity-20 dark:opacity-10 ...">
```

### Less Visible
```tsx
// Change opacity-10 to opacity-5
<div className="fixed ... opacity-5 dark:opacity-[0.025] ...">
```

### Remove Watermarks
Simply comment out or delete the watermark `<div>` elements.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Watermarks render on landing page
- [x] Watermarks render on dashboard
- [x] Watermarks render on sign-in page
- [x] Watermarks render on onboarding
- [x] Transparent logo works (no cream background)
- [x] All icon sizes generated
- [x] PWA install prompt works correctly
- [x] Theme colors updated to match logo
- [x] Navigation has subtle logo hint
- [x] Documentation complete

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to enhance the watermarks:

1. **Add animation**: Slow rotation or breathing effect
2. **Different images per page**: Use other logo variants
3. **Seasonal variations**: Change watermark for holidays
4. **User preference**: Toggle watermarks on/off in settings

---

**Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented
**Visibility**: Subtle by design (10-15% opacity)
**Performance**: Optimized with Next.js Image
**Browser Support**: All modern browsers

To see a more obvious version temporarily, change any `opacity-10` to `opacity-50` in the layout files.
