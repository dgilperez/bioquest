## 📝 Known Issues

1. **Sync Performance**: Initial sync with 200+ observations may take 30+ seconds
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting prevents API blocks
   - Future: Background job processing

2. **Quest System**: Currently placeholder only
   - Workaround: Not critical for MVP
   - Priority: High for v0.2.0

3. **No Test Coverage**: Tests not yet implemented
   - Risk: Medium
   - Priority: High for production

## 💡 Technical Highlights

### Type Safety
Complete TypeScript coverage with custom types for all entities. Separate `Badge` (database) and `BadgeDefinition` (template) types prevent runtime errors.

### Notification System
Toast notifications with automatic achievement detection during sync. Smart batching for multiple badges unlocked simultaneously.

### Animation Performance
CSS-based animations with minimal JavaScript overhead. Auto-cleanup prevents memory leaks.

### Error Resilience
Three-layer error handling: component-level ErrorBoundary, route-level error.tsx, and root-level global-error.tsx.

### Achievement Engine
Fully automated badge unlocking with extensible criteria system. Supports milestone, taxon, rarity, geography, time, and quality-based badges.
