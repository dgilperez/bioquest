  üéØ Feature Area 1: Enhanced Gamification

  Current State Analysis

  ‚úÖ What's Working:
  - Rarity calculation exists (normal/rare/legendary based on iNat observation counts)
  - Quest system fully built with daily/weekly/monthly rotation
  - Database has streak fields (currentStreak, longestStreak)
  - Badge criteria check for streaks
  - Celebration components are beautiful and ready

  ‚ùå What's Missing:
  - Streak calculation logic not implemented
  - Celebrations not triggered during actual gameplay events
  - Regional rarity not actively used (only global)
  - No rotating quest UI emphasis
  - No streak display in UI

  Game Design Philosophy

  Core Loop Enhancement:
  Observe ‚Üí Sync ‚Üí CELEBRATE! ‚Üí Discover Goals ‚Üí Observe (repeat)
           ‚Üë                ‚Üë
      Current gap      Current gap

  The celebration moment is psychologically critical - it's when dopamine hits and players feel rewarded. Right now, users have to manually check badge pages to see if they
  unlocked something. We need instant gratification.

  Feature 1.1: Enhanced Rarity System ‚≠ê

  Product Goal: Make rare finds feel EPIC

  Design:
  1. Multi-Level Rarity (expand beyond 3 levels)
  Mythic:     < 10 global observations    (+2000 pts) üíé
  Legendary:  < 100 global observations   (+500 pts)  ‚ú®
  Epic:       < 500 global observations   (+250 pts)  üåü
  Rare:       < 2000 global observations  (+100 pts)  üí†
  Uncommon:   < 10000 global observations (+25 pts)   üî∑
  Common:     >= 10000 observations       (base pts)  ‚ö™
  2. Regional Rarity Overlay
    - Calculate both global AND regional rarity
    - Display both in UI: "Rare globally, Mythic locally!"
    - Use iNat place_id for user's location
    - Bonus: "First in [your region]" badge moment
  3. Rarity Streaks
    - Track consecutive rare+ finds
    - "Hot Streak" bonus multiplier
    - Visual indicator on observation cards

  Implementation Priority: HIGH - Small code changes, big psychological impact

  Files to Modify:
  - src/lib/gamification/rarity.ts - Add new tiers
  - prisma/schema.prisma - Add rarity enum values
  - src/components/observations/AnimatedObservationCard.tsx - Show dual rarity

  Feature 1.2: Streak Tracking & Celebration üî•

  Product Goal: Build daily habit, reward consistency

  Game Design:
  - Daily Streak: Consecutive days with at least 1 observation
  - Weekly Streak: Consecutive weeks with at least 5 observations
  - Monthly Streak: Consecutive months with at least 15 observations

  Streak Milestones & Rewards:
  Days:    7 ‚Üí 14 ‚Üí 30 ‚Üí 60 ‚Üí 100 ‚Üí 365 ‚Üí 730 ‚Üí 1000
  Bonus:   +50  +100 +250 +500 +1000 +5000 +10k  +25k points
  Badges:  Already exist! (Daily Naturalist, Dedicated Observer)

  UI Components Needed:
  1. Streak Flame Display
    - Dashboard prominent placement
    - Animated flame gets bigger with longer streaks
    - Color shifts: üî• (orange) ‚Üí üîµ (blue) ‚Üí üíú (purple) for milestones
  2. Streak Risk Warning
    - "Your 37-day streak expires in 8 hours!" notification
    - Gentle push notification if enabled
  3. Streak Celebration
    - Milestone reaches trigger special animation
    - "7 Day Streak! üî•" banner with confetti
    - Progressive rewards displayed

  Implementation Priority: HIGH - Critical for retention

  Files to Create/Modify:

  - src/components/dashboard/StreakDisplay.tsx - NEW UI component
  - src/lib/stats/user-stats.ts - Add streak calculation to sync
  - src/components/celebrations/StreakMilestone.tsx - NEW celebration

  Feature 1.3: Rotating Quests Enhancement üéØ

  Current System: Quests rotate, but UI doesn't emphasize it

  Enhancements:
  1. Quest Refresh Countdown
    - "Daily quests refresh in 3h 24m"
    - Build anticipation for new challenges
  2. Quest Preview
    - Show sneak peek of upcoming quests
    - "Tomorrow: Mammal Hunter quest available"

  Files to Modify:
  - src/components/quests/QuestCard.tsx - Add countdown timer
  - src/app/(dashboard)/quests/page.client.tsx - Add refresh UI
  - src/lib/notifications/achievements.ts - Quest completion notification exists!

  Feature 1.4: Wire Up Celebrations üéâ

  Product Goal: Deliver instant dopamine hits

  What to Wire Up:

  1. Level Up Celebration
    - Trigger: User levels up during sync
    - Location: Right after sync completes
    - Component: LevelUpCelebration (ALREADY EXISTS!)
  2. Badge Unlock Ceremony
    - Trigger: Badge unlocked during sync
    - Location: After sync, queue multiple if needed
    - Component: BadgeUnlockCeremony (ALREADY EXISTS!)
  3. Rare Find Notification
    - Trigger: Rare/Legendary/Mythic observation synced
    - Location: Toast notification immediately
    - NEW component needed: RareFindToast
  4. Streak Milestone
    - Trigger: Streak reaches milestone (7, 14, 30, etc.)
    - Location: Right after observation counted
    - NEW component needed: StreakMilestone
  5. Quest Completion
    - Trigger: Quest progress reaches 100%
    - Location: During sync or on quests page
    - Toast notification (function exists in achievements.ts!)

  Implementation Strategy:
  // In sync route response
  return {
    newObservations,
    badgesUnlocked: [...],     // ‚Üê Already returned!
    questsCompleted: [...],    // ‚Üê Already returned!
    levelUp: { old, new },     // ‚Üê NEW to add
    streakMilestone: { days }, // ‚Üê NEW to add
    rareFinds: [...]          // ‚Üê NEW to add
  }

  // Client handles celebration queue
  showCelebration(syncResult)

  Implementation Priority: CRITICAL - This is the main ask!

  Files to Modify:
  - src/app/api/sync/route.ts - Return level up, streak, rare find data
  - src/app/(dashboard)/page.client.tsx - Handle celebration queue
  - src/lib/stats/user-stats.ts - Return additional celebration triggers

  üìä Feature Area 2: Leaderboards

  Game Design Philosophy

  Psychological Goals:
  - Social proof: "I'm in top 10 locally!"
  - Competition: Friendly rivalry
  - Discovery: Find active naturalists nearby
  - Motivation: "Just 50 points behind..."

  Anti-Goals (pitfalls to avoid):
  - ‚ùå Don't make it feel like work
  - ‚ùå Don't discourage beginners
  - ‚ùå Don't reward quantity over quality obsessively

  Feature 2.1: Leaderboard Types

  1. Global Leaderboard
    - Top 100 users worldwide
    - Filtered by: Points, Observations, Species, Rare Finds
    - Time periods: All-Time, This Year, This Month, This Week
  2. Local Leaderboard (Place-based)
    - Top 50 users in same place_id
    - Uses iNat place data (city, county, state)
    - More achievable for most users
  3. Taxon Leaderboard
    - Top users for specific taxa
    - "Top Bird Watchers", "Top Botanists", etc.
    - Encourages specialization
  4. Friends Leaderboard
    - Top 20 from your friend list
    - Most personal/engaging
    - Requires friend system (Phase 2)

  Feature 2.2: Database Schema

  New Table: LeaderboardEntry
  model LeaderboardEntry {
    id           String   @id @default(cuid())
    userId       String
    user         User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])

    leaderboardType  LeaderboardType  // global, local, taxon
    scope            String?          // place_id or taxon_name
    period           Period           // all_time, yearly, monthly, weekly

    rank             Int
    score            Int
    metric           Metric           // points, observations, species, rare_finds

    calculatedAt     DateTime @default(now())

    @@unique([userId, leaderboardType, scope, period, metric])
    @@index([leaderboardType, scope, period, metric, rank])
  }

  enum LeaderboardType {
    global
    local
    taxon
    friends
  }

  enum Period {
    all_time
    yearly
    monthly
    weekly
  }

  enum Metric {
    points
    observations
    species
    rare_finds
  }

  Feature 2.3: Calculation Strategy

  Approach: Pre-calculated rankings (not real-time)

  Why?
  - Performance: Leaderboards are expensive queries
  - Consistency: Everyone sees same data
  - Scalability: Can handle millions of users

  Calculation Schedule:
  - Hourly: Top 100 global (all metrics)
  - Daily: Local leaderboards (all places with 10+ users)
  - Weekly: Taxon leaderboards
  - On-demand: Friends leaderboard (small, can be real-time)

  Implementation:
  // Cron job or scheduled API route
  POST /api/leaderboards/calculate

  // Calculate rankings
  SELECT userId, SUM(points) as score
  FROM users
  WHERE lastObservationDate > [period_start]
  GROUP BY userId
  ORDER BY score DESC
  LIMIT 100

  // Store in LeaderboardEntry table

  Feature 2.4: UI Components

  1. Leaderboard Page (/leaderboards)
    - Tabs: Global | Local | Taxon | Friends
    - Filters: Time period, Metric
    - Your position highlighted
    - "Chase" feature: Show person ahead of you
  2. Mini Leaderboard Widget (Dashboard)
    - Show your local rank: "You're #7 in San Francisco!"
    - Quick motivation
  3. Profile Comparisons
    - Click user ‚Üí See their stats vs yours
    - "You have 12 more species than [user]"

  Feature 2.5: Weekly/Monthly Resets

  Design Choice: Don't reset, create NEW period leaderboards

  Reasoning:
  - Preserves historical data
  - Allows "This Month in History" features
  - Users can see progress over time

  Implementation:
  // Monthly leaderboard
  period: 'monthly'
  scope: '2025-01' // YYYY-MM format

  // Weekly leaderboard
  period: 'weekly'
  scope: '2025-W04' // ISO week format

  Automatic Archival:
  - Old period leaderboards stay in DB
  - UI shows current + last 12 periods
  - "View Historical Rankings" feature

  Implementation Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH - Important for engagement

  Files to Create:
  - prisma/schema.prisma - Add LeaderboardEntry model
  - src/app/api/leaderboards/calculate/route.ts - NEW calc endpoint
  - src/app/api/leaderboards/[type]/route.ts - NEW fetch endpoint
  - src/app/(dashboard)/leaderboards/page.tsx - NEW page
  - src/components/leaderboards/LeaderboardTable.tsx - NEW component
  - src/lib/leaderboards/calculate.ts - NEW calculation logic

  üìà Feature Area 3: Advanced Stats

  Game Design Philosophy

  Purpose: Transform BioQuest from "game" to "scientific tool"

  Users who stick around long-term want:
  - Deep insights into their observation patterns
  - Tools for planning expeditions
  - Understanding of biodiversity coverage
  - Life list management (common in birding apps)

  Feature 3.1: Taxonomic Coverage Charts

  Visual: Sunburst or Tree Map

  Data Shown:
  Animalia (487 obs)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Chordata (234 obs)

  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Reptilia (13 obs)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Arthropoda (198 obs)
  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Insecta (165 obs)
  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Arachnida (33 obs)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Mollusca (55 obs)

  Plantae (312 obs)
  Fungi (89 obs)

  Interactions:
  - Click to drill down
  - Hover to see stats
  - Compare to region/global averages

  Game Insight: "You've barely explored fungi! Try the Mycologist quest."

  Implementation:
  - Use Recharts or D3.js
  - Data from existing Observation.iconicTaxon and taxonName
  - Calculate tree structure dynamically

  Feature 3.2: Life List Management

  Concept: Checklist of all species observed

  Features:
  1. Full Life List
    - Sortable table: Species name, Date first seen, # observations
    - Filter by taxon, location, date range
    - Export as CSV
  2. Target Species
    - User can mark species as "targets" (want to see)
    - Show locations where recently observed
    - "Species near you" suggestions
  3. Milestones
    - "500 bird species!" celebration
    - "Complete North American sparrows" challenge
  4. Comparisons
    - "67% of birds in your region observed"
    - "123 species ahead of regional average"

  Implementation:
  - Query distinct taxonId from Observations
  - Store user targets in new TargetSpecies table
  - Cache counts in UserStats for performance

  Feature 3.3: Gap Analysis & Trip Planning

  Problem: "Where should I go to see new species?"

  Solution: Recommend locations based on species gaps

  Algorithm:
  1. Get user's observed species list
  2. Get species observed in candidate locations
  3. Calculate: Location score = (New species / Total species) * Activity
  4. Rank locations by score
  5. Show top 10 with details

  UI Display:
  üìç Muir Woods National Monument
     üÜï 87 new species possible
     üå≥ Strong for: Plants, Fungi, Birds
     üöó 23 miles away
     üìä High recent activity

     Top targets you haven't seen:
     - Northern Spotted Owl
     - Banana Slug
     - Coast Redwood

  Advanced Features:
  - Season consideration: "Best in spring for wildflowers"
  - Accessibility ratings
  - "Trip report" after visit

  Implementation:
  - Pre-calculate location scores nightly
  - Store in LocationScore table
  - Use iNat place API for location data

  Feature 3.4: Species Accumulation Curves

  Concept: Graph showing species count over time

  Visual: Line chart with milestones

  Insights:
  - "Discovery rate": Slope of curve
  - "Plateau detection": "You're seeing the same species repeatedly"
  - Predictions: "At current rate, you'll hit 1000 species by June"
  - Seasonal patterns: "You discover most species in spring"

  Implementation:
  - Query: Group observations by date, count distinct species cumulative
  - Use Recharts AreaChart
  - Calculate trend line with simple linear regression

  Example Chart:
  Species Count
    500 |                            ‚¨§ Current
        |                        ‚¨§
