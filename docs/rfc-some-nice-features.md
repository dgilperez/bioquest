  🎯 Feature Area 1: Enhanced Gamification

  Current State Analysis

  ✅ What's Working:
  - Rarity calculation exists (normal/rare/legendary based on iNat observation counts)
  - Quest system fully built with daily/weekly/monthly rotation
  - Database has streak fields (currentStreak, longestStreak)
  - Badge criteria check for streaks
  - Celebration components are beautiful and ready

  ❌ What's Missing:
  - Streak calculation logic not implemented
  - Celebrations not triggered during actual gameplay events
  - Regional rarity not actively used (only global)
  - No rotating quest UI emphasis
  - No streak display in UI

  Game Design Philosophy

  Core Loop Enhancement:
  Observe → Sync → CELEBRATE! → Discover Goals → Observe (repeat)
           ↑                ↑
      Current gap      Current gap

  The celebration moment is psychologically critical - it's when dopamine hits and players feel rewarded. Right now, users have to manually check badge pages to see if they
  unlocked something. We need instant gratification.

  Feature 1.1: Enhanced Rarity System ⭐

  Product Goal: Make rare finds feel EPIC

  Design:
  1. Multi-Level Rarity (expand beyond 3 levels)
  Mythic:     < 10 global observations    (+2000 pts) 💎
  Legendary:  < 100 global observations   (+500 pts)  ✨
  Epic:       < 500 global observations   (+250 pts)  🌟
  Rare:       < 2000 global observations  (+100 pts)  💠
  Uncommon:   < 10000 global observations (+25 pts)   🔷
  Common:     >= 10000 observations       (base pts)  ⚪
  2. Regional Rarity Overlay
    - Calculate both global AND regional rarity
    - Display both in UI: "Rare globally, Mythic locally!"
    - Use iNat place_id for user's location
    - Bonus: "First in [your region]" badge moment
  3. Rarity Streaks
    - Track consecutive rare+ finds
    - "Hot Streak" bonus multiplier
    - Visual indicator on observation cards

  Implementation Priority: HIGH - Small code changes, big psychological impact

  Files to Modify:
  - src/lib/gamification/rarity.ts - Add new tiers
  - prisma/schema.prisma - Add rarity enum values
  - src/components/observations/AnimatedObservationCard.tsx - Show dual rarity

  Feature 1.2: Streak Tracking & Celebration 🔥

  Product Goal: Build daily habit, reward consistency

  Game Design:
  - Daily Streak: Consecutive days with at least 1 observation
  - Weekly Streak: Consecutive weeks with at least 5 observations
  - Monthly Streak: Consecutive months with at least 15 observations

  Streak Milestones & Rewards:
  Days:    7 → 14 → 30 → 60 → 100 → 365 → 730 → 1000
  Bonus:   +50  +100 +250 +500 +1000 +5000 +10k  +25k points
  Badges:  Already exist! (Daily Naturalist, Dedicated Observer)

  UI Components Needed:
  1. Streak Flame Display
    - Dashboard prominent placement
    - Animated flame gets bigger with longer streaks
    - Color shifts: 🔥 (orange) → 🔵 (blue) → 💜 (purple) for milestones
  2. Streak Risk Warning
    - "Your 37-day streak expires in 8 hours!" notification
    - Gentle push notification if enabled
  3. Streak Celebration
    - Milestone reaches trigger special animation
    - "7 Day Streak! 🔥" banner with confetti
    - Progressive rewards displayed

  Implementation Priority: HIGH - Critical for retention

  Files to Create/Modify:
  - src/lib/gamification/streaks.ts - NEW calculation logic
  - src/components/dashboard/StreakDisplay.tsx - NEW UI component
  - src/lib/stats/user-stats.ts - Add streak calculation to sync
  - src/components/celebrations/StreakMilestone.tsx - NEW celebration

  Feature 1.3: Rotating Quests Enhancement 🎯

  Current System: Quests rotate, but UI doesn't emphasize it

  Enhancements:
  1. Quest Refresh Countdown
    - "Daily quests refresh in 3h 24m"
    - Build anticipation for new challenges
  2. Quest Preview
    - Show sneak peek of upcoming quests
    - "Tomorrow: Mammal Hunter quest available"
  3. Featured Quest
    - One quest per category gets 2x rewards
    - Rotates to highlight different play styles
  4. Quest Completion Celebration
    - Mini-celebration when quest completes
    - Toast notification with rewards earned
    - Progress bar fill animation

  Implementation Priority: MEDIUM - Nice UX improvements

  Files to Modify:
  - src/components/quests/QuestCard.tsx - Add countdown timer
  - src/app/(dashboard)/quests/page.client.tsx - Add refresh UI
  - src/lib/notifications/achievements.ts - Quest completion notification exists!

  Feature 1.4: Wire Up Celebrations 🎉

  Product Goal: Deliver instant dopamine hits

  What to Wire Up:

  1. Level Up Celebration
    - Trigger: User levels up during sync
    - Location: Right after sync completes
    - Component: LevelUpCelebration (ALREADY EXISTS!)
  2. Badge Unlock Ceremony
    - Trigger: Badge unlocked during sync
    - Location: After sync, queue multiple if needed
    - Component: BadgeUnlockCeremony (ALREADY EXISTS!)
  3. Rare Find Notification
    - Trigger: Rare/Legendary/Mythic observation synced
    - Location: Toast notification immediately
    - NEW component needed: RareFindToast
  4. Streak Milestone
    - Trigger: Streak reaches milestone (7, 14, 30, etc.)
    - Location: Right after observation counted
    - NEW component needed: StreakMilestone
  5. Quest Completion
    - Trigger: Quest progress reaches 100%
    - Location: During sync or on quests page
    - Toast notification (function exists in achievements.ts!)

  Implementation Strategy:
  // In sync route response
  return {
    newObservations,
    badgesUnlocked: [...],     // ← Already returned!
    questsCompleted: [...],    // ← Already returned!
    levelUp: { old, new },     // ← NEW to add
    streakMilestone: { days }, // ← NEW to add
    rareFinds: [...]          // ← NEW to add
  }

  // Client handles celebration queue
  showCelebration(syncResult)

  Implementation Priority: CRITICAL - This is the main ask!

  Files to Modify:
  - src/app/api/sync/route.ts - Return level up, streak, rare find data
  - src/app/(dashboard)/page.client.tsx - Handle celebration queue
  - src/lib/stats/user-stats.ts - Return additional celebration triggers

  📊 Feature Area 2: Leaderboards

  Game Design Philosophy

  Psychological Goals:
  - Social proof: "I'm in top 10 locally!"
  - Competition: Friendly rivalry
  - Discovery: Find active naturalists nearby
  - Motivation: "Just 50 points behind..."

  Anti-Goals (pitfalls to avoid):
  - ❌ Don't make it feel like work
  - ❌ Don't discourage beginners
  - ❌ Don't reward quantity over quality obsessively

  Feature 2.1: Leaderboard Types

  1. Global Leaderboard
    - Top 100 users worldwide
    - Filtered by: Points, Observations, Species, Rare Finds
    - Time periods: All-Time, This Year, This Month, This Week
  2. Local Leaderboard (Place-based)
    - Top 50 users in same place_id
    - Uses iNat place data (city, county, state)
    - More achievable for most users
  3. Taxon Leaderboard
    - Top users for specific taxa
    - "Top Bird Watchers", "Top Botanists", etc.
    - Encourages specialization
  4. Friends Leaderboard
    - Top 20 from your friend list
    - Most personal/engaging
    - Requires friend system (Phase 2)

  Feature 2.2: Database Schema

  New Table: LeaderboardEntry
  model LeaderboardEntry {
    id           String   @id @default(cuid())
    userId       String
    user         User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])

    leaderboardType  LeaderboardType  // global, local, taxon
    scope            String?          // place_id or taxon_name
    period           Period           // all_time, yearly, monthly, weekly

    rank             Int
    score            Int
    metric           Metric           // points, observations, species, rare_finds

    calculatedAt     DateTime @default(now())

    @@unique([userId, leaderboardType, scope, period, metric])
    @@index([leaderboardType, scope, period, metric, rank])
  }

  enum LeaderboardType {
    global
    local
    taxon
    friends
  }

  enum Period {
    all_time
    yearly
    monthly
    weekly
  }

  enum Metric {
    points
    observations
    species
    rare_finds
  }

  Feature 2.3: Calculation Strategy

  Approach: Pre-calculated rankings (not real-time)

  Why?
  - Performance: Leaderboards are expensive queries
  - Consistency: Everyone sees same data
  - Scalability: Can handle millions of users

  Calculation Schedule:
  - Hourly: Top 100 global (all metrics)
  - Daily: Local leaderboards (all places with 10+ users)
  - Weekly: Taxon leaderboards
  - On-demand: Friends leaderboard (small, can be real-time)

  Implementation:
  // Cron job or scheduled API route
  POST /api/leaderboards/calculate

  // Calculate rankings
  SELECT userId, SUM(points) as score
  FROM users
  WHERE lastObservationDate > [period_start]
  GROUP BY userId
  ORDER BY score DESC
  LIMIT 100

  // Store in LeaderboardEntry table

  Feature 2.4: UI Components

  1. Leaderboard Page (/leaderboards)
    - Tabs: Global | Local | Taxon | Friends
    - Filters: Time period, Metric
    - Your position highlighted
    - "Chase" feature: Show person ahead of you
  2. Mini Leaderboard Widget (Dashboard)
    - Show your local rank: "You're #7 in San Francisco!"
    - Quick motivation
  3. Profile Comparisons
    - Click user → See their stats vs yours
    - "You have 12 more species than [user]"

  Feature 2.5: Weekly/Monthly Resets

  Design Choice: Don't reset, create NEW period leaderboards

  Reasoning:
  - Preserves historical data
  - Allows "This Month in History" features
  - Users can see progress over time

  Implementation:
  // Monthly leaderboard
  period: 'monthly'
  scope: '2025-01' // YYYY-MM format

  // Weekly leaderboard
  period: 'weekly'
  scope: '2025-W04' // ISO week format

  Automatic Archival:
  - Old period leaderboards stay in DB
  - UI shows current + last 12 periods
  - "View Historical Rankings" feature

  Implementation Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH - Important for engagement

  Files to Create:
  - prisma/schema.prisma - Add LeaderboardEntry model
  - src/app/api/leaderboards/calculate/route.ts - NEW calc endpoint
  - src/app/api/leaderboards/[type]/route.ts - NEW fetch endpoint
  - src/app/(dashboard)/leaderboards/page.tsx - NEW page
  - src/components/leaderboards/LeaderboardTable.tsx - NEW component
  - src/lib/leaderboards/calculate.ts - NEW calculation logic

  📈 Feature Area 3: Advanced Stats

  Game Design Philosophy

  Purpose: Transform BioQuest from "game" to "scientific tool"

  Users who stick around long-term want:
  - Deep insights into their observation patterns
  - Tools for planning expeditions
  - Understanding of biodiversity coverage
  - Life list management (common in birding apps)

  Feature 3.1: Taxonomic Coverage Charts

  Visual: Sunburst or Tree Map

  Data Shown:
  Animalia (487 obs)
  ├─ Chordata (234 obs)
  │  ├─ Aves (187 obs)
  │  ├─ Mammalia (34 obs)
  │  └─ Reptilia (13 obs)
  ├─ Arthropoda (198 obs)
  │  ├─ Insecta (165 obs)
  │  └─ Arachnida (33 obs)
  └─ Mollusca (55 obs)

  Plantae (312 obs)
  Fungi (89 obs)

  Interactions:
  - Click to drill down
  - Hover to see stats
  - Compare to region/global averages

  Game Insight: "You've barely explored fungi! Try the Mycologist quest."

  Implementation:
  - Use Recharts or D3.js
  - Data from existing Observation.iconicTaxon and taxonName
  - Calculate tree structure dynamically

  Feature 3.2: Life List Management

  Concept: Checklist of all species observed

  Features:
  1. Full Life List
    - Sortable table: Species name, Date first seen, # observations
    - Filter by taxon, location, date range
    - Export as CSV
  2. Target Species
    - User can mark species as "targets" (want to see)
    - Show locations where recently observed
    - "Species near you" suggestions
  3. Milestones
    - "500 bird species!" celebration
    - "Complete North American sparrows" challenge
  4. Comparisons
    - "67% of birds in your region observed"
    - "123 species ahead of regional average"

  Implementation:
  - Query distinct taxonId from Observations
  - Store user targets in new TargetSpecies table
  - Cache counts in UserStats for performance

  Feature 3.3: Gap Analysis & Trip Planning

  Problem: "Where should I go to see new species?"

  Solution: Recommend locations based on species gaps

  Algorithm:
  1. Get user's observed species list
  2. Get species observed in candidate locations
  3. Calculate: Location score = (New species / Total species) * Activity
  4. Rank locations by score
  5. Show top 10 with details

  UI Display:
  📍 Muir Woods National Monument
     🆕 87 new species possible
     🌳 Strong for: Plants, Fungi, Birds
     🚗 23 miles away
     📊 High recent activity

     Top targets you haven't seen:
     - Northern Spotted Owl
     - Banana Slug
     - Coast Redwood

  Advanced Features:
  - Season consideration: "Best in spring for wildflowers"
  - Accessibility ratings
  - "Trip report" after visit

  Implementation:
  - Pre-calculate location scores nightly
  - Store in LocationScore table
  - Use iNat place API for location data

  Feature 3.4: Species Accumulation Curves

  Concept: Graph showing species count over time

  Visual: Line chart with milestones

  Insights:
  - "Discovery rate": Slope of curve
  - "Plateau detection": "You're seeing the same species repeatedly"
  - Predictions: "At current rate, you'll hit 1000 species by June"
  - Seasonal patterns: "You discover most species in spring"

  Implementation:
  - Query: Group observations by date, count distinct species cumulative
  - Use Recharts AreaChart
  - Calculate trend line with simple linear regression

  Example Chart:
  Species Count
    500 |                            ⬤ Current
        |                        ⬤
