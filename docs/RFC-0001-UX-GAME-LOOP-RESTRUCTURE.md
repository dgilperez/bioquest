# RFC-0001: UX & Game Loop Restructure

**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Product Team
**Created:** 2025-01-29
**Updated:** 2025-01-29
**Target Release:** v0.2.0 (4 weeks)

---

## Abstract

BioQuest currently suffers from **feature fragmentation** - 8 separate navigation items that feel like disconnected tools rather than a unified game experience. This RFC proposes consolidating navigation from 8 items to 4 cohesive sections, establishing clear game rules (ludus), and creating a core game loop that makes BioQuest feel like an engaging game, not a feature dashboard.

**Core Problem:** "It feels like a bag of features, not a game."

**Core Solution:** Restructure around a clear game loop: QUEST → ADVENTURE → OBSERVE → CELEBRATE → PROFILE → repeat.

## 1. Motivation

### 1.1 Jobs to be Done

When users "hire" BioQuest, they're trying to accomplish these core jobs:

#### Primary Jobs (95% of usage)

1. **"Help me discover what to observe next"**
   - Current pain: No clear guidance on where to go or what to look for
   - Expected outcome: Specific recommendations (locations, species, quests)
   - Frequency: Before every observation trip

2. **"Show me my progress and achievements"**
   - Current pain: Progress scattered across Stats, Badges, Leaderboards
   - Expected outcome: Unified view of "how am I doing?"
   - Frequency: Daily check-in, post-observation validation

3. **"Make my observations feel special"**
   - Current pain: Observations feel like data entry
   - Expected outcome: Celebration, rarity reveal, points awarded
   - Frequency: Immediately after syncing observations

4. **"Let me explore biodiversity knowledge"**
   - Current pain: Tree of Life is buried, taxonomic learning is passive
   - Expected outcome: Interactive exploration, "what exists that I haven't seen?"
   - Frequency: Weekly deep dives, planning sessions

#### Secondary Jobs (5% of usage)

5. **"Compare myself to others"**
   - Current pain: Leaderboards feel isolated
   - Expected outcome: Friendly competition context
   - Frequency: Occasional curiosity, after achievements

### 1.2 Current Problems

1. **No Clear Hierarchy**: All 8 nav items feel equally important (they're not)
2. **Fragmented Progress**: Stats, badges, and leaderboards are separate
3. **Passive Landing**: Dashboard is overview, not action-oriented
4. **Hidden Value**: Tree of Life and Trips aren't in main navigation
5. **Unclear Game Loop**: No sense of "what do I do → why → what's next?"
6. **Missing Ludus**: No clear rules, boundaries, or freedom of movement

### 1.3 Goals of This RFC

1. ✅ Consolidate navigation from 8 items to 4 sections
2. ✅ Establish clear game loop and progression
3. ✅ Define rules of play (ludus)
4. ✅ Create action-oriented entry point
5. ✅ Preserve all existing features (zero feature loss)
6. ✅ Improve discoverability of hidden features (Trips, Life List)
7. ✅ Make "game-ness" evident through structure, not just cosmetics

## 2. Current State Analysis

### 2.1 Existing Navigation (8 Items)

| Item | Icon | Current Purpose | Avg Usage* | Issues |
|------|------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| Dashboard | Home | Overview of stats | 80% | Passive, not actionable |
| Explore | Compass | Location recommendations | 20% | Buried, disconnected from quests |
| Observations | Eye | List all observations | 60% | Feels like database, not journal |
| Tree of Life | Network | Taxonomic browser | 15% | Hidden value, not integrated |
| Statistics | BarChart | Charts and graphs | 25% | Vanity metrics, no context |
| Badges | Trophy | Achievement collection | 35% | Isolated from other progress |
| Quests | Target | Challenge tracker | 40% | Separate from recommendations |
| Leaderboards | Users | Rankings | 10% | Isolated, no context |

*Estimated based on typical gamification app patterns

### 2.2 Existing Pages (Complete Inventory)

```
src/app/(dashboard)/
├── dashboard/page.tsx           ← Overview (will become /quest landing)
├── explore/page.tsx             ← Location recommendations
├── observations/page.tsx        ← Observation list
├── tree-of-life/page.tsx        ← Taxonomic browser
├── stats/
│   ├── page.tsx                 ← Advanced statistics
│   └── life-list/page.tsx       ← Species checklist (hidden!)
├── badges/page.tsx              ← Badge collection
├── quests/page.tsx              ← Quest list
├── leaderboards/page.tsx        ← Rankings
└── trips/
    ├── page.tsx                 ← Trip list (hidden!)
    └── [tripId]/page.tsx        ← Trip details (hidden!)
```

**Total:** 11 pages, but only 8 in main navigation

**Hidden features (not in nav):**
- `/stats/life-list` - Full species checklist
- `/trips` - Trip planning
- `/trips/[id]` - Trip details

### 2.3 Current User Journey (Problematic)

```
User opens app
  ↓
Lands on Dashboard (passive overview)
  ↓
Wonders "what should I do?"
  ↓
Clicks through 8 menu items looking for guidance
  ↓
Eventually goes to iNaturalist to observe (no clear connection to BioQuest goals)
  ↓
Returns to BioQuest, manually clicks Sync
  ↓
No celebration, just updated numbers
  ↓
Checks Badges page separately
  ↓
Checks Leaderboards page separately
  ↓
Loses motivation, logs out
```

**Pain points:** No clear direction, scattered rewards, no sense of progression

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

### 3.1 New Navigation (4 Sections)

| Section | Icon | Purpose | Mental Model |
|---------|------|---------|--------------|
| **QUEST** | 🎯 Target | "What should I do today?" | MMO quest log |
| **ADVENTURE** | 🗺️ Compass | "What exists that I haven't seen?" | Pokédex collection |
| **PROFILE** | 🏆 Trophy | "How am I doing overall?" | RPG character sheet |
| **JOURNAL** | 📖 Book | "My observation history" | Field journal |

### 3.2 The Core Game Loop

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                      │
│  QUEST → ADVENTURE → OBSERVE → CELEBRATE → PROFILE  │
│    ↑                                           ↓     │
│    └───────────────── Return ─────────────────┘     │
│                                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Phase 1: QUEST (Motivation)
**"What should I do today?"**
- Landing page shows 3 active quests (1 daily, 1 weekly, 1 monthly)
- Each quest shows progress bars, XP rewards, and time remaining
- Below quests: 3 recommended locations based on gap analysis
- CTA: "Plan Adventure" or "View Quest Details"

**Rules of Play:**
- Maximum 3 active quests per tier (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Completing quests awards XP, badges, and unlocks new quests
- Quests refresh on schedule (daily at midnight, weekly on Monday, monthly on 1st)

#### Phase 2: ADVENTURE (Exploration)
**"Where should I go? What exists that I haven't seen?"**
- Tree of Life shows completeness percentages: "You've seen 23/98 Diptera families in your region"
- Click any taxon to see missing species and where to find them
- Create trip with target species
- Gap analysis highlights high-value targets (rare + nearby + seasonal)

**Rules of Play:**
- The biodiversity world is your game board
- You "unlock" species by observing them (like Pokémon)
- Completeness % is your progression metric at each taxonomic level
- Regional filtering changes your "difficulty level" (local = easier, global = harder)

#### Phase 3: OBSERVE (Action)
**[This happens in iNaturalist - outside BioQuest]**
- User goes outside with trip plan
- Makes observations in iNaturalist app
- Returns to BioQuest to sync

#### Phase 4: CELEBRATE (Reward)
**"What did I just accomplish?"**
- Sync triggers immediate feedback:
  - Rarity reveal animation for each observation
  - Points awarded with visual counter
  - Level up celebration (if applicable)
  - Badge unlocks (if triggered)
  - Quest progress updates
  - Streak milestone (if achieved)

**Rules of Play:**
- Every observation has value (base points)
- Rarer observations = exponentially more points
- Consecutive rare finds = streak multiplier
- Certain combinations trigger badges
- Filling taxonomic gaps awards bonus XP

#### Phase 5: PROFILE (Validation)
**"How am I doing overall?"**
- Level and XP prominently displayed
- Badge wall showing unlocked + locked badges with unlock criteria
- Leaderboard rank (local + global)
- Lifetime stats (species count, observation count, rarest finds)

**Rules of Play:**
- Your level is permanent and always increases
- Badges are permanent achievements
- Leaderboards reset monthly/yearly (temporary competition)
- Stats accumulate forever (long-term progression)

### 3.3 Key Interactions (Primary Verbs)

The game centers around these **active verbs**, not passive "view stats":

1. **ACCEPT** (quests) - "Accept this daily quest"
2. **EXPLORE** (biodiversity) - "Explore Diptera families"
3. **TARGET** (species) - "Add to target list"
4. **PLAN** (adventures/trips) - "Plan adventure to Muir Woods"
5. **SYNC** (observations) - "Sync my observations" → triggers reward cascade
6. **UNLOCK** (badges/achievements) - "You unlocked Badge X!"
7. **COMPLETE** (quests/trips) - "Quest complete! +200 XP"
8. **COMPARE** (leaderboards) - "Compare with naturalists in my region"

### 4.2 Feature Preservation Checklist

- [x] Dashboard overview → QUEST landing
- [x] Explore locations → QUEST/locations
- [x] Observations list → JOURNAL + ADVENTURE/observations
- [x] Tree of Life → ADVENTURE/tree
- [x] Statistics → PROFILE/stats
- [x] Life List (hidden) → ADVENTURE/life-list ✅ Now visible!
- [x] Badges → PROFILE/badges
- [x] Quests → QUEST/all
- [x] Leaderboards → PROFILE/leaderboards
- [x] Trips (hidden) → ADVENTURE/trips ✅ Now visible!
- [x] Trip details (hidden) → ADVENTURE/trips/[id] ✅ Now visible!

**Result:** All 11 existing pages accounted for, 0 features lost, 2 hidden features surfaced.

### 4.3 Redirect Plan

To prevent broken bookmarks and links:

```typescript
// next.config.js redirects
const redirects = [
  { source: '/dashboard', destination: '/quest', permanent: false },
  { source: '/explore', destination: '/quest/locations', permanent: false },
  { source: '/observations', destination: '/journal', permanent: false },
  { source: '/tree-of-life', destination: '/adventure/tree', permanent: false },
  { source: '/tree-of-life/:taxonId', destination: '/adventure/tree/:taxonId', permanent: false },
  { source: '/stats', destination: '/profile/stats', permanent: false },
  { source: '/stats/life-list', destination: '/adventure/life-list', permanent: false },
  { source: '/badges', destination: '/profile/badges', permanent: false },
  { source: '/quests', destination: '/quest/all', permanent: false },
  { source: '/leaderboards', destination: '/profile/leaderboards', permanent: false },
  { source: '/trips', destination: '/adventure/trips', permanent: false },
  { source: '/trips/:id', destination: '/adventure/trips/:id', permanent: false },

## 7. Risks & Mitigations

### 7.1 Risk: User Confusion from Navigation Change

**Impact:** High (affects all users)
**Probability:** Medium (major UX change)

**Mitigations:**
1. Add one-time tooltip on first visit: "We've reorganized! Your features are now in QUEST, ADVENTURE, PROFILE, and JOURNAL"
2. Create in-app migration guide accessible from help menu
3. Redirect all old URLs to new structure (prevents 404s)
4. Announce change via email/notification before launch
5. Provide feedback mechanism for users to report confusion

**Rollback plan:** Keep old navigation component in codebase, can switch back via feature flag if adoption is poor.

### 7.2 Risk: Feature Discoverability

**Impact:** Medium (some features may be harder to find initially)
**Probability:** Medium (users have muscle memory)

**Mitigations:**
1. Ensure all existing pages accessible within 2 clicks from landing pages
2. Add search functionality to find specific features (future enhancement)
3. Include site map link in footer
4. Track analytics on feature access rates, iterate on discoverability

### 7.3 Risk: Development Complexity

**Impact:** Medium (timeline and scope creep)
**Probability:** Medium (4-week aggressive timeline)

**Mitigations:**
1. Phase implementation over 4 weeks (iterative releases)
2. Reuse existing components (minimal new code)
3. Focus on routing/layout changes, not feature rebuilds
4. Test each phase before proceeding
5. Have dedicated QA pass at end of each week

**Timeline buffer:** Week 5 for polish and bug fixes.

### 7.4 Risk: Mobile Navigation Crowding

**Impact:** Medium (mobile-first user base)
**Probability:** Low (4 items should fit)

**Mitigations:**
1. Use bottom tab bar on mobile (native app pattern)
2. Icons clearly represent sections
3. Test on small screens (iPhone SE size) early
4. Consider hamburger menu if needed (but avoid if possible)

### 7.5 Risk: Performance Regression

**Impact:** Medium (affects user experience)
**Probability:** Low (mostly static routing changes)

**Mitigations:**
1. Maintain Server Component usage (no unnecessary client components)
2. Code-split landing pages
3. Lazy load widgets on landing pages
4. Monitor Core Web Vitals before/after
5. Run Lighthouse audits on new pages

## 8. Open Questions

### 8.1 Design Decisions Needed

**Q1:** Should QUEST be the default landing page after login?
- **Options:**
  - A) Always land on `/quest` (action-oriented)
  - B) Land on last visited section (preserve user preference)
- **Recommendation:** A (force action-oriented entry), but track analytics to validate

**Q2:** How should we handle the sync celebration cascade?
- **Options:**
  - A) Full-screen overlay (immersive, blocks interaction)
  - B) Toast notifications (non-blocking, less celebratory)
  - C) Modal with skip button (middle ground)
- **Recommendation:** C (modal with skip, but auto-dismiss after 5 seconds per reward)

**Q3:** Should we remove "Dashboard" terminology entirely?
- **Options:**
  - A) Keep `/dashboard` as redirect, update all copy to "Quest"
  - B) Keep "Dashboard" as synonym (e.g., breadcrumbs say "Dashboard / Quest")
- **Recommendation:** A (fully commit to game terminology)

**Q4:** Should trips be shown in main ADVENTURE landing or hidden until created?
- **Options:**
  - A) Always show "Active Trips" section (even if empty with CTA)
  - B) Only show trips widget if user has created trips
- **Recommendation:** A (educate users about trip feature)

### 8.2 Technical Decisions Needed

**Q5:** Should we use Next.js redirects or rewrite routes?
- **Options:**
  - A) Redirects (301/302) - old URLs redirect to new URLs in browser
  - B) Rewrites (transparent) - old URLs show new content, URL doesn't change
- **Recommendation:** A (redirects) - make the URL change visible to users, helps with bookmarking

**Q6:** Should landing pages be Server Components or Client Components?
- **Recommendation:** Server Components with client islands (maintain performance)

**Q7:** Should we version the API routes for this change?
- **Recommendation:** No, API routes remain unchanged (this is frontend-only)
