Hey Product Hunt! üëã

I'm excited to launch **BioQuest**, a gamified companion app for iNaturalist that turns biodiversity observation into an RPG-style adventure!

### The Problem
iNaturalist is amazing for citizen science, but there's no immediate feedback or sense of progression. Uploading observations can feel repetitive, especially for youth and newcomers.

### The Solution
BioQuest adds gamification WITHOUT compromising data quality:

**üéÆ Comprehensive XP System**
- Base: 10 XP per observation
- New species: +50 XP
- Rare species: up to +2,000 XP
- Research grade: +25 XP
- Photos: +5 XP each (max 3)
- First regional observation: +1,000 XP!

Check out our interactive XP calculator to plan your observations!

**üèÜ 40+ Badge System**
Unlock achievements across 7 categories: Milestones, Taxon Explorer, Rarity Hunter, Geography, Seasonal, Challenges, and Secret badges. Each has Bronze ‚Üí Platinum tiers.

**üìÖ Quest System**
Daily, weekly, and monthly challenges keep you motivated. "Document 3 plants today" or "Find 15 insects this week" with timers and progress bars.

**üíé Automatic Rarity Classification**
Every observation is classified: Common ‚Üí Uncommon ‚Üí Rare ‚Üí Epic ‚Üí Legendary ‚Üí Mythic. Imagine the thrill of finding your first Legendary species!

**üó∫Ô∏è Trip Planning**
Browse location recommendations, see "new species possible" counts, set target species, and track progress.

### Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- PostgreSQL + Prisma
- iNaturalist OAuth
- PWA (Flutter mobile app coming Q2 2025)

### Who It's For
- üßí Youth/beginners who need motivation
- üéØ Completionists who want to fill taxonomic gaps
- üèÜ Competitive naturalists hunting rare species
- üåç Educators running bioblitzes or nature clubs

### Ethics & Privacy
- ‚úÖ Encourages quality observations (research-grade bonus)
- ‚úÖ Respects geoprivacy settings
- ‚úÖ Read-only (doesn't modify iNaturalist data)
- ‚úÖ No spamming incentives
- ‚úÖ Free forever, no ads

**Not affiliated with iNaturalist** - we're an independent companion app.

### Try It Now

## üé§ Interview Prep (if Product Hunt reaches out)

**Q: What inspired you to build BioQuest?**
A: I'm an avid iNaturalist user with 500+ observations, but I noticed my motivation waning after the initial excitement. There was no sense of progression or immediate feedback. I wanted to bring the addictive game mechanics from Duolingo and Strava to citizen science‚Äîwithout compromising data quality.

**Q: How do you ensure gamification doesn't encourage spam?**
A: Great question! We incentivize QUALITY through research-grade bonuses (+25 XP) and photo bonuses. We DON'T give points for bulk uploads. Plus, all data still goes through iNaturalist's verification process. We're adding a gamification layer, not changing how iNaturalist works.

**Q: What's next for BioQuest?**
A: Phase 2 is a Flutter mobile app (Q2 2025) with camera integration, offline mode, and push notifications. Phase 3 adds social features like following other naturalists and group quests for bioblitzes. Long-term, we want to integrate AI for auto-ID suggestions and personalized quest recommendations.

**Q: Why free? What's the business model?**
A: BioQuest is free forever with no ads. This is a passion project for the citizen science community. If it scales, we might explore grants from conservation nonprofits or optional donations, but the core experience will always be free.
