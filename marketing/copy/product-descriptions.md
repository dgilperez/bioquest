# BioQuest: Transform Nature Observation into an Epic Adventure

## The Problem We're Solving

iNaturalist is incredible for citizen science, but uploading observations can feel repetitive. There's no immediate feedback, no sense of progression, and no gamification to keep users engaged—especially youth and newcomers.

**BioQuest changes that.**

## What is BioQuest?

BioQuest is a **free, unofficial companion app** for iNaturalist that transforms your biodiversity observations into an RPG-style adventure game. Think Pokémon GO meets citizen science.

We add the gamification layer that iNaturalist intentionally avoids, without compromising data quality or scientific integrity.

## Core Features

### 🎮 Comprehensive XP System
Every observation earns Experience Points (XP):
- **Base XP:** 10 points (always!)
- **New Species Bonus:** +50 XP for first-time species
- **Research Grade Bonus:** +25 XP for community-verified IDs
- **Photo Bonus:** +5 XP per photo (max 3)
- **Rarity Bonuses:** Common (0) → Mythic (+2,000 XP)
- **First Observation Bonuses:** Regional (+1,000) or Global (+5,000)

**Transparency is key:** Our dedicated "How XP Works" page includes an interactive calculator so users can optimize their observations.

### 🏆 40+ Badge System (7 Categories)
Unlock achievements across:
- **Milestone Badges:** 10, 100, 1,000 observations
- **Taxon Explorer:** Species counts per group (birds, plants, insects)
- **Rarity Hunter:** Rare, Epic, Legendary finds
- **Geography:** Locations visited, countries explored
- **Time/Seasonal:** Streaks, seasonal activity
- **Challenges:** Quest completions
- **Secret Achievements:** Easter eggs for dedicated naturalists

Each badge has Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum tiers.

### 📅 Quest System
**Daily Quests:** Quick wins (e.g., "Upload 1 observation today" - 75 XP)
**Weekly Quests:** Medium effort (e.g., "Find 5 bird species" - 350 XP)
**Monthly Quests:** Themed challenges (e.g., "Pollinator Month: 10 pollinators" - 1,800 XP)
**Personal Quests:** User-created goals

Quests have timers and progress bars to create urgency and momentum.

### 💎 Automatic Rarity Classification
BioQuest analyzes global iNaturalist data to classify every observation:
- **Mythic:** <10 observations worldwide
- **Legendary:** 10-99 observations
- **Epic:** 100-499 observations
- **Rare:** 500-1,999 observations
- **Uncommon:** 2,000-9,999 observations
- **Common:** 10,000+ observations

Imagine the thrill of discovering your observation is **Legendary**! 🤩

### 🗺️ Trip Planning with Target Species
Create naturalist adventures:
1. Browse location recommendations (nearby parks, nature reserves)
2. See "new species possible" counts
3. Select target species (e.g., "Northern Spotted Owl")
4. Set priorities and goals
5. Track progress during your trip

BioQuest shows you **where to go** and **what to look for** based on your observation history.

### 📊 Advanced Analytics
- **Life List:** All species you've observed, searchable/filterable
- **Tree of Life Browser:** Explore taxonomic completeness
- **Gap Analysis:** What major groups are you missing?
- **Observation Trends:** Charts, heatmaps, seasonal patterns
- **Leaderboards:** Compete globally or regionally

### 🔄 Seamless iNaturalist Integration
- **OAuth Login:** Secure authentication (we NEVER see your password)
- **Automatic Sync:** Pull observations, photos, IDs from iNaturalist
- **Respects Privacy:** Honors geoprivacy settings
- **Read-Only:** We don't modify your iNaturalist data
- **Attribution:** Proper credit for all observations and photos

## Who It's For

### 🌍 Educators & Group Leaders

## Technical Stack

## Ethical Considerations

We take data quality and wildlife ethics seriously:

✅ **Respects Privacy:** Geoprivacy settings honored
✅ **Never Spammy:** Anti-spam measures prevent low-quality uploads
✅ **Ethical Observation:** No incentives for disturbing animals or trespassing
✅ **Data Integrity:** We don't modify iNaturalist data, only add gamification

**Not affiliated with iNaturalist** - we're an independent, unofficial companion app.

## Why Now?

**Gamification works.** Duolingo proved it for language learning. Strava proved it for running. BioQuest brings it to biodiversity.

## Get Started

1. Visit bioquest.app
2. Sign in with iNaturalist
3. Sync your observations
4. Start earning XP and unlocking badges!

**Free forever.** No ads, no premium tiers. Just pure gamified citizen science.
