## 🎨 Brand Guidelines

### Tone
- Friendly but not overly casual
- Excited but not hyperbolic
- Educational without being preachy
- Humble, not promotional

### Visual Style
- Natural earth tones (greens, browns, blues)
- Clean, modern UI screenshots
- Minimal text overlays
- High contrast for accessibility

### Key Messages
1. **Complementary, not competitive**: BioQuest adds to iNat, doesn't replace it
2. **Quality over quantity**: Gamification designed to encourage better observations
3. **Transparent and ethical**: Open about how XP works, respects privacy
4. **Community-driven**: Built by naturalists, for naturalists

## 💬 Response Templates

### Positive Feedback
"Thank you! [Personalized response]. What feature would you like to see next?"

### Ethics Concerns
"Great question! BioQuest incentivizes quality through research-grade bonuses (+25 XP) and photo bonuses. We don't reward spam or bulk uploads. All observations still go through iNat's verification process."

### Privacy Concerns
"BioQuest is read-only and respects all geoprivacy settings. We never modify your iNaturalist data. Your data stays on iNat – we just add gamification on top."

### Technical Questions
"Built with Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Prisma. PWA now, Flutter native app coming Q2 2025. Planning to open source once code is cleaned up!"

### Feature Requests
"Love this idea! I'll add it to the roadmap. What's your use case for [feature]?"
